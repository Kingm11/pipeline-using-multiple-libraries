# Creating pipline using scikit-learn, pandas, Seaborn, Yellowbrick
## Overview

1. ### The dataset includes measurements of the length and width of the petals and sepals of the flowers.
2. ### The goal of this project is to build a pipeline using scikit-learn, pandas, Seaborn, and Yellowbrick.

3. ### We will use scikit-learn's load_iris() function to load the dataset.
4. ### The dataset will be split into training and testing sets using train_test_split() function.
5. ### A pipeline will be created using Pipeline() function which includes StandardScaler() and LogisticRegression() for preprocessing and training respectively.
6. ### The model will be trained on the training set.
7. ### Yellowbrick will be used to visualize the confusion matrix for the model using the testing set.
8. ### Seaborn will be used to visualize the relationship between the features and the target using the entire dataset.
9. ### The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.


## Scope 

1. ### The project aims to build a pipeline using scikit-learn, pandas, Seaborn, and Yellowbrick.
2. ### The pipeline will preprocess the data, train a logistic regression model, and visualize the results.
3. ### The iris dataset will be used to train the logistic regression model.
4. ### Yellowbrick will be used to visualize the confusion matrix for the model using the testing set.
5. ### Seaborn will be used to visualize the relationship between the features and the target using the entire dataset.
6. ### The project will help us gain an understanding of how to build a machine learning pipeline using popular libraries.
7. ### The project will help us evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
8. ### The scope of the project is limited to the iris dataset and logistic regression model. However, the pipeline can be extended to other datasets and models as well.



## Data

### For this Project, we will use the classic Iris dataset, which contains information about the physical characteristics of different types of iris flowers.


## Steps

1. ### Load the iris dataset using scikit-learn's load_iris() function.
2. ### Split the dataset into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split() function.
3. ### Create a pipeline using scikit-learn's Pipeline() function. The pipeline should include a StandardScaler() to preprocess the data and a LogisticRegression() classifier to train the model.
4. ### Train the model using the training set.
5. ### Use Yellowbrick to visualize the confusion matrix for the model using the testing set.
6. ### Use Seaborn to visualize the relationship between the features and the target using the entire dataset.
7. ### Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
